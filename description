The goal of this game is to defeat the main villain. To achieve that goal,
the hero can travel through various cities, in each city are some
valuable items and interesting people, which can help you or fight you,
depending on their hostility. To help you, there is also a capsule,
in which you can travel through time. When you do,
items and people in all places change accordingly to that era.

The player must allocate some skill points at the start of the game.
Points can go to 3 attributes: strength, speed, charisma.
This will help him in his venture. Also it will help to set hostility,
which determines, whether NPCs will attack him, or talk to him.
NPCs also have these attributes and every NPC has some item of value to player
and also some weakness.

Hero also has an inventory which is limited by his strength attribute.
And he has limited number of items that can be also equipped, this grants
some bonuses to players attributes and some special ability, mostly bonus
against someone. Items also has hidden special ability that can help hero
to even win the game without a fight.

Player traverses through cities, in every city there are places,
these can lead to any number (mostly one or two) other places. In every place
can be an item or a person. Player may choose (or may be forced) to interact
with the person in that place. Dialog will have multiple option answers and
can lead to multiple endings of the dialog. Fight also provides multiple
options for the player like flee, defend himself, attack enemy and others.
If hero dies, he is reset to capsule and his items are removed,
but he can continue and finish the game, although the environment won't change.
If enemy dies, he will drop some amount of money and also some item.
There can also be items in places just waiting to be taken.
Also there will be places, that require having some exact item for entering.
But this will not prevent player from going through the entire city, just
prevents him from entering and possibly acquiring something really valuable.
